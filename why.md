I love asking why. Questions are always how we find answers and why is a particularly special question because it empowers us to act. For example, why do I want a car? If the pros out way the cons, you are empowered to get one with confidence. And vice versa. In this file, I'm going to explore the whys behind digital technology at it's deepest levels. That's where I get some of my most lasting motivation.

### Intelligent Tools

It seems to me that the internet, computers, electronics, bikes, and other inventions are simply intelligent tools. I thinks it's facinating that have been able to insert bits of logic into tools. Isn't that one of the pillars of technology? Technology is creating tools that do things better, faster, w/ less effort. The less effort part is the part where we are injecting some of our intelligence into a tool so that we don't have to handle it (and ideally focus on even deeper tasks and problems). Automate what you can so you can move on to other things.

### Linguistics

Alot of computer programing is linguistics, syntax, grammar, vocabulary. I loved learning Russian because it could express things in different ways and opened up a whole to new world to me. Computer languages can do the same. The languages don't sounds as beautiful

### Logic

Computer programing is about logic, problem solving, automation.
