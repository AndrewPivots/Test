# Feed Reader Testing

This project is to test my ability to add Jasmine js tests to an existing Udacity project.

## How To Use

1. Open index.html to view tests at the bottom of the page.
2. To review the code for the tests, open /jasmine/spec/feedreader.js

## Future Development Ideas
1. Test menu functionality in a more actual way and not just an artifact of the process.
2. Test feed loading without have to make the page load strange.

## Projects Feedback
1. FEB 4: My project reviewer thinks I over complicated most of my tests. This may have been partially because I wanted to stick to the methods I was most confident in at the time. I used a lot of loops to check more nodes which is a more thorough way of doing things but likely over-complicated it. But I did like implementing his method and techniques to make things simpler.

## Sources
1. CALLBACKS & NESTING: Karine L's thread in the Knowledge Center helped me understand nesting asynchronous functions with the callback. https://knowledge.udacity.com/questions/14179
2. QUERY SELECTOR: My project reviewer recommends .querySelector over getElementsByClassName. Maybe because it's a more versatile method.
3. CLASS LIST: My project reviewer recommends .classList of .className but I don't know why.
