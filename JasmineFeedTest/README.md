# Feed Reader Testing

This project is to test my ability to add Jasmine js tests to an existing Udacity project.

## How To Use

1. Open index.html to view tests at the bottom of the page.
2. To review the code for the tests, open /jasmine/spec/feedreader.js

## Future Development Ideas
1. Test menu functionality in a more actual way and not just an artifact of the process.
2. Test feed loading without have to make the page load strange.
