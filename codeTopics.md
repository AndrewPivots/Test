# Code Topics

When learning anything, it's helpful to learn by isolating individual topics and breaking them down. This is particularly true with computer programing because the techniques and concepts are esspecially layered and abstract. I've listed below some of the topics that I found most challenging or interesting.

## Variables

When I first learned about variables, it felt abstract. I didn't understand how a word could hold all this different stuff in it. And where was it saved? I was used to files, like a text file that you can see saved on your desktop. I now understand and use variables regularly but there are still unanswered questions that I find fascinating and which help me program.
1. Where is a variable saved?
2. Why are functions run when declared in a variable statement?
3. I really like this metaphor of the variables being [like a grocery bag](https://webbjocke.com/javascript-variables/).
